I defended my PhD in the Information Security group of David Basin at ETH Zurich in summer 2021. Before that, I completed BSc and MSc computer science degrees at TU Munich, and a BA degree in philosophy at LMU Munich.

I am on the job market for the academic hiring season in fall 2021. Please feel free to get in touch with me.
