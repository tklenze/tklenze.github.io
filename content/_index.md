Since July 2022 I am a visiting research scientist at DFINITY in Zurich, Switzerland.

I defended my PhD in the Information Security group of David Basin at ETH Zurich in summer 2021 and was a postdoc in the same group until June 2022. Before that, I completed BSc and MSc computer science degrees at TU Munich, and a BA degree in philosophy at LMU Munich.
